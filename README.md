# 🎮 Game Finder – Game Lab Final Project (CS50x)

> A web application that provides two types of game search engines:  
> - 🔍 **Free-to-Play Game Explorer**  
> - 🤖 **Game Recommendation Engine** (Free + Paid)

Built as my **final project for Harvard’s CS50x**, this app demonstrates real-world full-stack development, API usage, and recommendation logic.

🔒 **Note:** Source code is kept private in accordance with CS50’s academic integrity policy.  
📩 However, a private walkthrough or demo can be shared upon request.
